    <string name="description_shining">Writer Jack Torrens (Jack Nicholson) with his wife and son Denny arrives at Overlock Hotel, located on the snowy peaks of Colorado. The luxurious interior of a hotel lost in white solitude, a heap of halls, symmetrical corridors, a puzzle of the maze. So begins the film \"Radiance\" (1979) based on the novel by Stephen King.</string>
    <string name="description_cloud_atlas">The film is about how the past and the future are closely intertwined, and that one action, even a minor one, that occurred in the past, can affect, through generations, the fate of people in a completely different country, or even the whole world</string>
